         * IMPLEMENTATION IDEA
         * 
         * Go through every pair of words on the board and check:
         *    1. If the words have the same orientation (both DOWN or both ACROSS), then they cannot intersect anywhere
         *          a. Since they have the same orientation, if they DO intersect, they must have the same row or same column
         *          b. The problem reduces to finding whether or not two 1D ranges overlap (well known trick for doing this), or can just use brute force
         *    2. If the words have different orientations, they can intersect at most one point
         *          a. Brute force can be used, or we can find the intersections of the lines, and check if the intersection point lies in both segments
         *    3. Check to make sure that the words are different (since all words must be unique)
